<h2> What is Depression</h2>
<p> It is a mental health disorder characterized by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life.Some people with depression describe depression as “living in a black hole” or having a feeling of impending doom, others feel lifeless, empty, and apathetic. </p>
<br>

<h2> Types of Depression</h2>

<h4> Major Depression</h4>
<p>Major depression is much less common than mild or moderate depression and is characterized by severe, relentless symptoms.</p>
<p> When left untreated, major depression typically lasts for about six months, and some people experience just a single major depressive episode in their lifetime, however major depression can be a recurring disorder.</p>

<h4> Atypical Depression</h4>
<p>Atypical depression is a common subtype of major depression with a specific symptom pattern.</p>
<p> It responds better to some therapies and medications than others (depending on the patient), so identifying it can be helpful.People with atypical depression experience a temporary mood lift in response to positive events, such as after receiving good news or while out with friends.
Other symptoms of atypical depression include weight gain, increased appetite, sleeping excessively, a heavy feeling in the arms and legs, and sensitivity to rejection.
